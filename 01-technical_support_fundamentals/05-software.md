# Introduction to Software


## What is Software?


### Coding

Translating one language to another.


### Scripting

Coding in a scripting language.

The concept of taking a complex system and simplifying it for use.

## Recipe for Computer


### Assembly language

Allowed computer scientists to use human readable instructions, assembled into code, that the machine could understand.


### Compiled programming languages

Uses human readable instructions, then sends them through a compiler.


### Interpreted programming languages

The script is run by an interpreter, which interprets the code into CPU instructions just in time to run them.
