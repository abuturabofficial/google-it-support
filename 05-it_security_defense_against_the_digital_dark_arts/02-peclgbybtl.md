# Symmetric Encryption

## Cryptography

The cryptography has two main fields:

  + Cryptology: The study of cryptographic methods.
  + Cryptanalysis: The study of breaking the cryptography.

### Encryption

The act of taking a message, called **plaintext**, and applying an operation to it, called a **cipher**, so that you receive a garbled, unreadable message as the output, called **ciphertext**.

The reverse is **Decryption**.

The Cipher is made up of two components:

  + Encryption algorithm
  + Key

### Encryption algorithm

The underlying logic of the process that's used to convert the plaintext into ciphertext.

These algorithms are usually very complex. But there are also simple algorithms as well.

**Security through obscurity** is a principle where underlying encryption algorithm is also kept hidden for security purposes. But you shouldn't rely on it, as once the underlying mechanism is discovered, your whole security will wash away.

The underlying principle of cryptography is called **Kirchhoff's principle**.

### Cryptosystem

A collection of algorithms for key generation and encryption and decryption operations that comprise a cryptographic service should remain secure â€“ even if everything about the system is known, except the key.

  + The system should remain secure even if your adversary knows exactly what kind of encryption systems you're employing, as long as your **keys remain secure.**

### Frequency analysis

The practice of studying the frequency with which letters appear in a ciphertext.

An Arab mathematician of 9th century, used this first cryptographic method

### Steganography

The practice of hiding the information from observers, but not encoding it.

  + The writing of messages with invisible ink.
  + The modern steganographic techniques involves, hiding the code/scripts in the PDF or image files etc.

## Types of cryptanalysis attack

### Known-Plaintext Analysis (KPA)

Requires access to some or all the of the plaintext of the encrypted information. The plaintext is not computationally tagged, specially formatted, or written in code. The analyst's goal is to examine the known plaintext to determine the key used to encrypt the message. Then they use the key to decrypt the encoded information.

### Chose-Plaintext Analysis (CPA)

Requires that the attacker knows the encryption algorithm or has access to the device used to do the encryption. The analyst can encrypt one block of chosen plaintext with the targeted algorithm to get information about the key. Once the analyst obtains the key, they can decrypt and use sensitive information. 

### Ciphertext-Only Analysis (COA)

 Requires access to one or more encrypted messages. No information is needed about the plaintext data, the algorithm, or data about the cryptographic key. Intelligence agencies face this challenge when intercepting encrypted communications with no key.

### Adaptive Chosen-Plaintext attack (ACPA)

ACPA is similar to a chosen-plaintext attack. Unlike a CPA, it can use smaller lines of plaintext to receive its encrypted ciphertext and then crack the encryption code using the ciphertext.

### Meddler-in-the-Middle (MITM)

MITM uses cryptanalysts to insert a meddler between two communication devices or applications to exchange their keys for secure communication. The meddler replies as the user, and then performs a key exchange with each party. The users or systems think they communicate with each other, not the meddler. These attacks allow the meddler to obtain login credentials and other sensitive information.

## Symmetric Cryptography

These types of algorithms use the same key for encryption and decryption.

### Substitution cipher

An encryption mechanism that replaces parts of your plaintext with ciphertext.

  + E.g., Caesar cipher, ROT13 etc.

### Stream cipher

Takes a stream of input and encrypts the stream one character or one digit at a time, outputting one encrypted character or digit at a time.

  + Initialization vector (IV) is used, to add a random string of characters to the key.

### Block ciphers

The cipher takes data in, places it into a bucket or block of data that's a fixed size, then encodes that entire block as one unit.

## Symmetric Encryption Algorithms

### Data Encryption Standard (DES)

One of the earliest standard is **Data Encryption Standard (DES)**.

  + With input from NSA, IBM developed it in the 1970s.
  + It was used as a FIPS.
  + Used 64-bits key sizes.

### FIPS

Federal Information Processing Standard.

### Standard Encryption Standard (AES)

**NIST** (National Institute of Standards and Technology), adopted **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)** in 2001.

  + 128-blocks, twice the size of DES blocks, and supports key length of 128-bits, 192-bits, or 256-bits.
  + Because of the large key size, brute-force attacks on AES are only theoretical right now, because the computing power required (or time required using modern technology) exceeds anything feasible today.

An important thing to keep in mind when considering various encryption algorithms is **speed**, and **ease of implementation**.

### RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4)

A symmetric stream cipher that gained widespread adoption because of its simplicity and speed.

  + Abandoned due to inheritance weaknesses.

# Public Key or Asymmetric Encryption

## Asymmetric Cryptography

Asymmetric or Public Key ciphers.

Two different keys are used for encryption and decryption.

The three concepts that an asymmetric cryptosystem grants us are:

  + Confidentiality
  + Authenticity
  + Non-repudiation

Symmetric encryption is used for key exchange.

### Message Authentication Codes or MACs

A bit of information that allows authentication of a received message, ensuring that the message came from the alleged sender and not a third party.

#### HMAC

Keyed-hash messaged authentication code.

### CMACs

Cipher-Based Message Authentication Codes.

#### CBC-MAC

Cipher block chaining message authentication codes.

## Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms

### RSA

The first practical asymmetric cryptography systems to be developed is **RSA**.

Pretty complex math is involved in generating key pair for RSAs.

This crypto system was patented in 1983 and was released to the public domain by RSA Security in the year 2000. 
  
### Digital Signature Algorithm or DSA

It was patented in 1991, and is part of the US government's Federal Information Processing Standard.

Similar to RSA, the specification covers the key generation process along with the signing and verifying data using the key pairs. It's important to call out that the security of this system is dependent on choosing a random seed value that's incorporated into the signing process. If this value was leaked or if it can be inferred if the prime number isn't truly random, then it's possible for an attacker to recover the private key.

### Diffie-Hellman

Named after coworkers, invented it. It is solely used for key exchange.

Let's assume we have two people who would like to communicate over an unsecured channel, and let's call them Suzanne and Daryll. First, Suzanne and Daryl agree on the starting number that would be random and will be a very large integer. This number should be different for every session and doesn't need to be secret. Next, each person decides another randomized large number, but this one is kept secret. Then, they combine their shared number with their respective secret number and send the resulting mix to each other. Next, each person combines their secret number with the combined value they received from the previous step. The result is a new value that's the same on both sides, without disclosing enough information to any potential eavesdroppers to figure out the shared secret. This algorithm was designed solely for key exchange, though there have been efforts to adapt it for encryption purposes. 

### Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)

A public-key encryption system that uses the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields to generate secure keys.

![[Pasted image 20221012152354.png]]

  + The benefit of elliptic curve based encryption systems is that they are able to achieve security similar to traditional public key systems with smaller key sizes. So, for example, a 256 bit elliptic curve key, would be comparable to a 3,072 bit RSA key. This is really beneficial since it reduces the amount of data needed to be stored and transmitted when dealing with keys. 
  + Both Diffie-Hellman and DSA have elliptic curve variants, referred to as **ECDH** and **ECDSA**, respectively.
  + The US NEST recommends the use of EC encryption, and the NSA allows its use to protect up to top secret data with 384 bit EC keys
  + But, the NSA has expressed concern about EC encryption being potentially vulnerable to quantum computing attacks, as quantum computing technology continues to evolve and mature.

# Hashing
A type of function or operation that takes in an arbitrary data input and maps it to an output of fixed size, called a hash or digest.

![[Pasted image 20221012160358.png]]

  + You feed in any amount of data into a hash function, and the resulting output will always be the same size. But the output should be **unique to the input**, such that two different inputs should never yield the same output.
  + Hashing can also be used to identify duplicate data sets in databases or archives to speed up searching tables, or to remove duplicate data to save space.
  + Cryptographic hashing is distinctly different from encryption because cryptographic hash functions should be one directional.
+ The ideal cryptographic has function should be **deterministic**, meaning that the same input value should always return the same hash value.
+ The function should not allow **Hash collisions**.

### Hash collisions

Two different inputs mapping to the same output.

![[Pasted image 20221012161018.png]]

## Hashing Algorithms

### MD5

Designed in early 1990s. Operates on 512-bits block and generates 128-bits hash digest.

  + While MD5 was designed in 1992, a design flaw was discovered in 1996, and cryptographers recommended using the **SHA-1** hash.
  + In 2004, it was discovered that is MD5 is susceptible to hash collisions.
  + In 2008, security researchers create a fake SSL certificate that was validated due to MD5 hash collision.
  + Due to these very serious vulnerabilities in the hash function, it was recommended to stop using MD5 by 2010.
  + In 2012, this hash collision was used for nefarious purposes in the flame malware, which used to forge a Microsoft digital certificate to sign their malware, which resulted in the malware appearing to be from legitimate software that came from Microsoft.

### SHA-1

SHA-1 is part of the Secure Hash Algorithm suite of functions, designed by the NSA, published in 1995.

During the 2000s, a bunch of [theoretical attacks](https://eprint.iacr.org/2005/010) against SHA1 were formulated, and some [partial collisions](https://eprint.iacr.org/2007/474) were demonstrated.

  + Operated at 512-bits blocks and use 160-bits hash digest.
  + It is used in popular protocols like:
    + TLS/SSL
    + PGP SSH
    + IPsec
    + VCS like git
  + NIST recommended stopping the use of SHA-1, and relying on SHA-2 in 2010.
  + Major browsers vendor dropped support for SSL certificates that use SHA-1 in 2017.
  + In early 2017, [full collision of SHA-1](https://shattered.io/) was published. Two PDFs were created with same SHA-1 hashes.
  + **MIC or Message Integrity Check** to make sure there is no data corruption in transit to the hash digest.

### Defense against hash attacks

The passwords should not be stored in plaintext, instead they should be hashed and, store a hash.

  + Brute-force attack against a password hash can be pretty computationally expensive, depending upon the hash system used.
  + A successful brute force attack, against even the most secure system imaginable, is a function of attacker time and resources.
  + Another common methods to help raise the computational bar and protect against brute force attacks is to run the password through the hashing function multiple times, sometimes through thousands of iterations.
  + A **rainbow** table is ta table of precalculated hashes.

![[Pasted image 20221012163307.png]]

  + To protect against these precalculated rainbow tables, **password salt** come into play.

### Password salt

Additional randomized data that's added into the hashing function to generate a hash that's unique to the password and salt combination.

  + Modern systems use 128-bits salt.
  + It means there are 2^128 possible salt combination.
